# Addressing the Mental Health Crisis in India:
Mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety, continue to pose a significant challenge in India. Unfortunately, there is often a lack of sufficient response and support systems in place to address these concerns. The stigma surrounding mental health further compounds the problem, preventing many individuals from seeking the help they need.

We believe it is crucial to raise awareness about mental health and bridge the gap in available resources. To highlight the gravity of the situation, we recommend watching the Mohak Mangal video on depression in India:

# Our Vision:
At A.I.D.A, we envision a future where mental health is prioritized and accessible to all. We strive to create a community where individuals can openly discuss their mental health concerns without fear of judgment or stigma. Through A.I.D.A-S.O.S, we aim to provide a user-friendly platform that empowers users to take control of their mental well-being and seek the support they need.

#Future Developments:
We are committed to continuous improvement and development. In our future iterations, we plan to incorporate neurofeedback games, which have shown promising results in aiding mental health treatment. These games will allow users to engage in interactive activities that promote relaxation, stress reduction, and emotional regulation.

By integrating neurofeedback games into A.I.D.A-S.O.S, we aim to provide an engaging and holistic approach to mental health support. This expansion will enable users to not only receive guidance and support through conversations but also actively participate in activities that can have a positive impact on their mental well-being.

We believe that everyone deserves access to effective mental health support, and we are dedicated to harnessing the potential of artificial intelligence and technology to make this a reality.
