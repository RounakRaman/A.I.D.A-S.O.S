# A.I.D.A-S.O.S

Welcome to A.I.D.A-S.O.S, an innovative app developed by expert AI/ML developers to provide support to individuals struggling with mental health issues, specifically depression and anxiety. A.I.D.A (Artificial Intelligence for Depression and Anxiety) is an umbrella organization committed to leveraging the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve mental health outcomes globally.

# How A.I.D.A-S.O.S Works:
A.I.D.A-S.O.S is an AI-generated chatbot system designed to assist users in coping with their mental health concerns. By leveraging advanced natural language processing techniques, our chatbot engages in meaningful conversations with users, offering guidance, support, and empathy. Through this interaction, A.I.D.A-S.O.S aims to improve the user's overall well-being and help them develop effective strategies for managing their mental health.

# Implementation Process:

- Developed an app, A.I.D.A-S.O.S, targeting individuals with mental health issues to provide support and help improve their condition.

- Utilized generative techniques to create an AI-generated chatbot system that addresses users' concerns, engages in conversation, and offers guidance and consolidation.

- Due to GPT-3 not being open-source, opted to use Bard API, which provided smooth and effective results for the chatbot functionality.Also since Bard is linked to google search retriever it provided better results

- Designed the app using Streamlit, a powerful framework for building data-driven web applications in Python.

# Testing & Optimization Results:

- Conducted extensive testing to ensure the app's functionality, usability, and accuracy in addressing users' mental health issues on local host network.
  
- Optimized the chatbot's responses and behavior and added session states so that it looks like a normal chat history that is suitable for conversation
  
- Incorporated API key techniques to enhance the chatbot's understanding and provide more meaningful interactions along side giving valid responses and maintaing reliabiltiy
  
- Incorporated a governmental helpline number for patients having severe mental health issues
  
- Implemented a contact us form to get feedback from the user
  
# Challenges Encountered:

- The main challenge was the unavailability of GPT-3 as an open-source model. To overcome this, the Bard API was utilized, which still provided satisfactory results for the chatbot's functionality.

- Transitioning from local app hosting to server hosting introduced complexities, as the app's functionalities had to adapt to different environments and configurations.
  
- Integration of Streamlit for new functionalities presented certain challenges, requiring additional effort for seamless implementation and compatibility.

- Merging real-time analysis with a database posed challenges, especially in ensuring efficient data management and synchronization to be incorporated using MongoDB


# Conclusion:

A.I.D.A-S.O.S is a promising app aimed at supporting individuals with mental health issues. The implementation process involved leveraging AI/ML techniques and utilizing the Bard API for the chatbot's functionality. Testing and optimization ensured the app's effectiveness in addressing users' concerns. Despite challenges related to the choice of AI model, app hosting, integration with Streamlit, and real-time analysis, A.I.D.A-S.O.S stands as a valuable tool for providing mental health support.

# Future Developments:

We are committed to continuous improvement and development. In our future iterations, we plan to incorporate neurofeedback games, which have shown promising results in aiding mental health treatment. These games will allow users to engage in interactive activities that promote relaxation, stress reduction, and emotional regulation.

By integrating neurofeedback games into A.I.D.A-S.O.S, we aim to provide an engaging and holistic approach to mental health support. This expansion will enable users to not only receive guidance and support through conversations but also actively participate in activities that can have a positive impact on their mental well-being.

We believe that everyone deserves access to effective mental health support, and we are dedicated to harnessing the potential of artificial intelligence and technology to make this a reality.
