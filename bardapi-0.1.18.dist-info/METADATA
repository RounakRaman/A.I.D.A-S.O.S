**Please exercise caution and use this package responsibly.**

I referred to [this github repository(github.com/acheong08/Bard)](https://github.com/acheong08/Bard) where inference process of Bard was reverse engineered. Using `__Secure-1PSID`, you can ask questions and get answers from Google Bard. This package is designed for application to the Python package [ExceptNotifier](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/ExceptNotifier) and [Co-Coder](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Co-Coder). Please note that the bardapi is not a free service, but rather a tool provided to assist developers with testing certain functionalities due to the delayed development and release of Google Bard's API. It has been designed with a lightweight structure that can easily adapt to the emergence of an official API. Therefore, I strongly discourage using it for any other purposes.

<br>


# [hf-transllm](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/hf-transllm)
If you want to test the open-llama model, which is `released under the Apache License (allowing free commercial use)` in `various languages`, you can try using the [hf-transllm](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/hf-transllm) package. hf-transllm also supports multilingual inference for various LLMs stored in hugging face repository.

##  [Amazing Bard Prompts](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/amazing-bard-prompts) Is All You Need!
- Helpful prompts for Google Bard

<br>

## Install
If you will not provide the language parameter (use `english`, `korean`, `japanese` only as input text):
```
pip install bardapi
```

If you wish to use the Bard API, including various features:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Bard-API.git
```

<br>

## Authentication
> **Warning** Do not expose the `__Secure-1PSID` 
1. Visit https://bard.google.com/
2. F12 for console
3. Session: Application → Cookies → Copy the value of  `__Secure-1PSID` cookie.

Note that while I referred to `__Secure-1PSID` value as an API key for convenience, it is not an officially provided API key. 
Cookie value subject to frequent changes. Verify the value again if an error occurs. Most errors occur when an invalid cookie value is entered.

<br>

If you need to set multiple Cookie values

- [Bard Cookies](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Bard-API/blob/main/README_DEV.md#bard-which-can-get-cookies) - After confirming that multiple cookie values are required to receive responses reliably in certain countries, I will deploy it for testing purposes. Please debug and create a pull request


<br>

## Usage 
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zzzlTIh0kt2MdjLzvXRby1rWbHzmog8t?usp=sharing) 


Simple Usage

```python
from bardapi import Bard

token = 'xxxxxxx'
bard = Bard(token=token)
bard.get_answer("나와 내 동년배들이 좋아하는 뉴진스에 대해서 알려줘")['content']
```
Or you can use this
```python
from bardapi import Bard
import os
os.environ['_BARD_API_KEY']="xxxxxxx"

Bard().get_answer("나와 내 동년배들이 좋아하는 뉴진스에 대해서 알려줘")['content']
```

To get reponse dictionary
```python
import bardapi
import os

# set your __Secure-1PSID value to key
token = 'xxxxxxx'

# set your input text
input_text = "나와 내 동년배들이 좋아하는 뉴진스에 대해서 알려줘"

# Send an API request and get a response.
response = bardapi.core.Bard(token).get_answer(input_text)
```



Addressing errors caused by delayed responses in environments like Google Colab and containers. If an error occurs despite following the proper procedure, utilize the timeout argument.
```python
from bardapi import Bard
import os
os.environ['_BARD_API_KEY']="xxxxxxx"

bard = Bard(timeout=30) # Set timeout in seconds
bard.get_answer("나와 내 동년배들이 좋아하는 뉴진스에 대해서 알려줘")['content']
```

<br>

## Further
### Behind a proxy
If you are working behind a proxy, use the following.
```python
from bardapi import Bard
import os

# Change 'http://proxy.example.com:8080' to your http proxy
# timeout in seconds
proxies = {
    'http': 'http://proxy.example.com:8080',
    'https': 'https://proxy.example.com:8080'
}

bard = Bard(token='xxxxxxx', proxies=proxies, timeout=30)
bard.get_answer("나와 내 동년배들이 좋아하는 뉴진스에 대해서 알려줘")['content']
```

### Reusable session object
You can continue the conversation using a reusable session.
```python
from bardapi import Bard
import os
import requests
os.environ['_BARD_API_KEY'] = 'xxxxxxx'
# token='xxxxxxx'

session = requests.Session()
session.headers = {
            "Host": "bard.google.com",
            "X-Same-Domain": "1",
            "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.114 Safari/537.36",
            "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=UTF-8",
            "Origin": "https://bard.google.com",
            "Referer": "https://bard.google.com/",
        }
session.cookies.set("__Secure-1PSID", os.getenv("_BARD_API_KEY")) 
# session.cookies.set("__Secure-1PSID", token) 

bard = Bard(token=token, session=session, timeout=30)
bard.get_answer("나와 내 동년배들이 좋아하는 뉴진스에 대해서 알려줘")['content']

# Continued conversation without set new session
bard.get_answer("What is my last prompt??")['content']
```

# [More features](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Bard-API/blob/main/README_DEV.md)
Starting from version `0.1.18`, the GitHub version of BardAPI will be synchronized with the PyPI version and released simultaneously. <br>

# Example code of [hf-transllm](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/hf-transllm)
<details>
<summary>In case the Google package is no longer available due to policy restrictions, here's a simple example code for using open-source language models (LLMs) in both English and multiple languages.</summary>

<br>

## Usage
For the decoder models provided by Hugging Face, you can easily use them by either following a simple approach or overriding the inference method. You can explore various open-source language models at [this link](https://huggingface.co/models). Through the ranking information from [Open LLM Leader Board Report repository](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Open-LLM-Leaderboard-Report), you can find information about good models.

### For LLM that use languages `other than English`
```python
from transllm import LLMtranslator

open_llama3b_kor = LLMtranslator('openlm-research/open_llama_3b', target_lang='ko', translator='google') # Korean

trnaslated_answer = open_llama3b_kor.generate("나와 내 동년배들이 좋아하는 뉴진스에 대해서 알려줘")
print(trnaslated_answer)
```


### For LLM that use `English`
Refer https://github.com/openlm-research/open_llama or using like this:
```python
from transllm import LLMtranslator

open_llama3b = LLMtranslator('openlm-research/open_llama_3b) 

answer = open_llama3b.generate("Tell me about the Korean girl group Newjeans.")
print(answer)
```

</details>

## Scripts
In the scripts [folder](./scripts/), I have released a script to help you compare [OpenAI-ChatGPT](./scripts/openai_api.ipynb), [Microsoft-EdgeGPT](./scripts/microsoft_api.ipynb) and [Google-Bard](./scripts/google_api.ipynb). I hope they will help more developers.

## Shifting Service Policies: Bard and Google's Dynamics 
Bard's service status and Google's API interfaces are in constant flux. *The number of replies is currently limited, but certain users,* such as those utilizing VPNs or proxy servers, have reported slightly higher message caps. Adaptability is crucial in navigating these dynamic service policies. Please note that the cookie values used in this package are not official API values.
            
## Bugs and Issues
Sincerely grateful for any reports on new features or bugs. Your valuable feedback on the code is highly appreciated.
